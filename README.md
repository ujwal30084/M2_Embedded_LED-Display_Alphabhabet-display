## About Project
8x8 LED Matrix contains 64 LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes) which are arranged in the form of a matrix, hence the name is LED matrix. We are going to make this Matrix by soldering 64 LEDs on to the perfboard or DOT PCB. The LEDs can be of any color, choose the ones which are available with you. Then we will write a C program for ATmega32 AVR Microcontroller to control these 64 LEDs matrix. The ATmega, according to program, powers appropriate LEDs to show characters in scrolling fashion.
